<p><b>The Belgian Gazette</b></p>
<p>We constantly scan all tweets published by a panel of about 2000 multidisciplinary Belgian tweeps, mostly people who follow the news from close, people with a broad interest scope and people whose opnion matters. Every 15 minutes on the 15th minute, we filter out the 5 most important/popular entries and publish them here on The Belgian Gazette a.k.a. Ga-Z.
			</p>

			<p>
				- We try to avoid tweets from people with extrimist opinions.<br/>
				- We try to avoid marketing tweets.<br/>
				- We will favor tweets containing terms that seem to matter for our public.<br />
				- We will devaluate tweets containing offensive words or terms that point to possible extremist or fundamentalist opinions
			</p>

			<p>
				This way, we come up with a very limited set of tweets that will show what Belgian people esteem important at this moment.
